# HtmltoTextFile

HtmltoTextFile is a class for taking a Html file as input and writing the data as text data in an output text document

## Usage

Requires:
 - an HTML doc to be "parsed", see String inputFileName = "dataStructures.html" for an example.
 - a txt doc to output the data into, see String outputFileName = "output.txt" for an example.
 - All three folders must be in the same directory, as the class assumes they are.

Steps:
  1. Define a correct input file name and output file name - HtmltoTextFile assumes the files are all in the same directory.
  2. java HtmltoTextFile.java - Accepts string arguments but does not change the function
